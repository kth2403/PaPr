Skill Action Sequence:

When a skill is casted, an action sequence can be played. This is done by using tag in the skill¡¯s note.

User:
These actions will act on the user.
user casting [true OR false]
When set to true the user will be marked as ¡°casting¡±. If he is hit with a skill that has ¡°cancel¡± on damage, this skill will be canceled.
user lock
Prevent any movement of the player until unlock
user unlock
The player will be able to move again
user speed [inc OR dec] [amount]
Increase or decrease the player¡¯s move speed by X amount
user move [forward OR backward] [distance] [wait for completion? Default: false]
Moves the player forward or backward by X pixels. If wait for completion is set to true, then the ABS will wait until the player has finished moving before going to the next step.
user jump [forward OR backward] [distance in pixels] [wait for completion? Default: false]
Makes the player jump forward or backward by X pixels, in Y frames. If wait for completion is set to true, then the ABS will wait until the player has finished moving before going to the next step.
user jumphere [wait for completion? Default: false]
Make the player jump to skill¡¯s location. If wait for completion is set to true, then the ABS will wait until the player has finished moving before going to the next step.
user slide [wait for completion? Default: false]
Make the player slide to skill¡¯s location. If wait for completion is set to true, then the ABS will wait until the player has finished moving before going to the next step.
user teleport
Make the player instantly teleport to skill¡¯s location.
user directionfix [true OR false]
If set to true, it will lock the player¡¯s direction to the current one. If set to false, it will unlock it.
user pose [poseName] [wait for completion? Default: false]
Make the player change its animation for a set pose. Needs Quasi Sprite to work.
user forceskill [skillId]
Forces the player to cast a skill, even if he didn¡¯t learn it.
user animation [animationId] [angleOffset]
Plays an animation at the users location.
Skill/collider:
These actions will act on the skill/collider.
trigger
This will trigger the skill. This is necessary for the skill to set damage, to have its animation showed, and to be used at all.
store
This will store the current colliders position. To be used with movetostored
clearstore
This will clear the stored colliders position. To be used with movetostored
movetostore
This will move the collider to the stored position.
move [forward OR backward] [distance in pixels] [duration] [wait for completion? Default: false]
Moves the skill forward or backward by X pixels for Y number of frames. If wait for completion is set to true, then the ABS will wait until the player has finished moving before going to the next step.
wave [forward OR backward] [amplitude] [harmonics] [distance in pixels] [duration in frames] [wait for completion? Default: false]
Moves the skill forward or backward in a wave pattern, using the amplitude and harmonics parameters, for X pixels, in Y frames. If wait for completion is set to true, then the ABS will wait until the player has finished moving before going to the next step.
picture [fileName] [rotatable? Default: false] [baseDirection]
Set the skill to be represented by a picture (e.g. for an arrow). Set the file name to the name of the picture without the extension. If rotatable is set to true, then the picture will rotate depending on the player¡¯s angle. Set base direction to where the picture is facing by default. 2 means facing down, 4 means facing left, 6 means facing right and 8 means facing up.
You can set the picture to have an animation. For that, make your animation on a single line, going from left to right. Then in the filename, add #[numberOfFrames-WaitTimeBetweenFrames].
Let¡¯s take an example:
image013
In this case, if I want it to wait 15 frames between each animation frame the picture would be named whatever#[3-15].
image015
trail [fileName] [rotatable? Default: false] [baseDirection]
Set the skill to have a trail (e.g. for a grappling hook). Set the file name to the name of the picture without the extension. If rotatable is set to true, then the picture will rotate depending on the skill¡¯s angle. Set base direction to where the picture is facing by default. 2 means facing down, 4 means facing left, 6 means facing right and 8 means facing up.
collider [show OR hide]
Set to show or hide the skill¡¯s collider. This also shows the ground targeting and select targeting zones.
animation [animationID]

Other:
wait [duration]
Waits for [duration] frames before going to the next step
se [name] [volume] [pitch] [pan]
Plays a sound effect by [name] and set its [volume], [pitch] and [pan]
globallock
Locks every movement. Events and player. Only works if Quasi Movement Plus is installed
globalunlock
